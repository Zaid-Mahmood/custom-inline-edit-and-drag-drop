        steps: "It’s fun to make Natural Calm and watch it fizz.\n Just add Natural Calm magnesium to a 1/4 cup of hot (preferably boiling) water, let fizz and enjoy! You can then add cool water or add it to juice! Our Natural Calm magnesium powders dissolve fast in hot water and become ionic magnesium citrate.\nIt’s never been easier to manage stress, release tension, and calm your mind."
