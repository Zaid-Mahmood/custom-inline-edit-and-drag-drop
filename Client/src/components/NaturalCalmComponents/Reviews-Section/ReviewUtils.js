        reviewText: "“This tastes so good that my kids ask for it every night! They are very picky, so I’m glad to be able to easily get all this goodness into them! I make it as a hot drink for myself before bed.\n My daughter and son both get leg cramps and my son is <span>diagnosed</span> ADD so sometimes winding down from the day is very challenging for him. This has helped them both to settle in for bedtime and it’s a product I can feel good about giving them and myself.",

I know once they try it they’ll love it too!",
